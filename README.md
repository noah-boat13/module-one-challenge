# Module 1 Challenge

## Description
This project's purpose was to help outline what code refractoring is and how it can apply to CSS and HTML without altering the external look of a webpage. 
As a coding student, new to HTML, CSS, and overall coding pricipals this project helped reinforced concepts learned during the first week of class as well as helping building new understanding of common practices in the software development word: such as DRY coding. 
It solves the overall problem of having unneccesary blocks of code doing the same task, which can slow down a webpage or cause other internal issues, overall lowering user satisfaction.
My project stands out because it uses flexbox elements to reformat the header and navigation bar after changing semantic elements in the HTML file. In addition, I blocked out the redundant code given at the start of the assignment instead of just deleting it.

## Credits
During this project I pair programmed with one of my classmates, Vic Swain and together we were able to work through the various challenges that arose while providing insight and input back and forth until the solution was found.
